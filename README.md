# Demo for PwC project: Few-Shot Anomaly Detection in Financial Time Series.

We have applied our method to real-world stock market manipulation data, completing a successful case study in practical financial anomaly detection. 

In this study, we have collected Chinese stock market trading data containing real manipulation cases. Some examples are placed in the folder `Trans_data`.

We also developed a platform to demonstrate the detection process and performance of our method. Users can apply the platform by running the file `app.py`. For details on how to use this platform, please refer to the corresponding demo video.
